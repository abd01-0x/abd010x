Hi there 👋, my name is Adeoye Abolaji David (abd for short) and I was a chartered financial accountant up until 2022. 

I quit that for data, for web2 and web3 data analytics, while learning still towards being a data engineer. 


## Interesting stuffs about me
- 👀 I’m seeking roles as a data or blockchain analyst. Help a brother :D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about web2 data towards building an AI. This includes designing & developing a database/data warehouse, scraping and loading data into the DB/DW, applying predictive modeling thinking, etc. This is for a product/startup idea I have. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about web3/blockchain data by researching protocol documentation and analyzing its data via Dune Analytics and Flipside Crypto.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other data professionals on predictive modeling and natural language processing.
