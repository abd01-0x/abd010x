Hi there 👋, my full names are Adeoye Abolaji David (abd for short) and I was a financial accountant up until 2022. 
I quit that for data, for web2 and web3 data analytics, while venturing still towards being a data engineer. 

I am currently seeking data or blockchain analysis roles, but in the mean time, working on a project. 
What project? = To build my own AI, which of course means designing & developing a database/data warehouse, scraping and loading data into the DB/DW, applying predictive statistics thinking, amongst other sub-tasks that goes into building an AI.   

- 👋 Hi, I’m @abd01-0x
- 👀 I’m interested in data and blockchain analytics, coming from the accountancy profession.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about web2 data, by building a database towards building an AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about web3 data and blockchain analytics via Dune Analytics, Flipside Crypto, Layer3, and MetricsDAO.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on predictive modeling and statistics, and natural language processing.
