Hi there 👋, my name is Adeoye Abolaji David (abd for short) and I was a chartered financial accountant up until 2022. 
I quit that for data, for web2 and web3 data analytics, while learning still towards being a data engineer. 

I am currently seeking open data or blockchain analysis roles, but in the mean time, working on a project. What project? 
= To build my own AI, which of course as a bewly minted data professional means designing & developing a database/data warehouse, scraping and loading data into the DB/DW, applying predictive statistics thinking, amongst other sub-tasks that goes into building an AI.   

- 👀 I’m looking for help with job opportunities (data or blockchain roles)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about web2 data, by developing a database towards building an AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about web3/blockchain data by researching & analyzing protocols via Dune Analytics, Flipside Crypto, Layer3, and MetricsDAO.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other data professionals on predictive modeling and natural language processing.
