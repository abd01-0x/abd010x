Hi there, my full names are Adeoye Abolaji David (abd for short) and I was a financial accountant up until 2022. 
I quit that for data, for web2 and web3 data analytics, while venturing still towards being a data engineer. 

I am currently seeking data or blockchain analysis roles, but in the mean time, working on a project. 

Being new to the data field and wanting to understand everything in-depth, i decided to kickoff a project


- 👋 Hi, I’m @abd01-0x
- 👀 I’m interested in data and blockchain analytics, coming from the accountancy profession.
