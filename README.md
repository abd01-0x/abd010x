Hi there 👋, my name is Adeoye Abolaji David (abd for short) and I am a chartered financial accountant that practiced as an auditor for over 5 years, up until 2022. 

I decided to transition into the tech space though, into web2 and web3 data analytics. 
I am currently seeking open positions as a data or blockchain analyst. 

I could add value to any organization in various ways, inclusive of; 
* Data analysis (in SQL, Power BI, Dune) complemented by delightful dashboards 
* Researching on blockchain protocols e.g. [UNI DIgestible](https://dune.com/abd010x/uni-digestible)
* Database design & development
* Researching on data & AI matters.   


## Interesting stuffs about me
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a Database/Data warehouse towards building a predictive algorithm. This includes designing & developing a database, scraping and loading data into the DB/DW, applying predictive modeling thinking, etc. This is for a product/startup idea I have. 
- 🌱 I’m currently building a Newsletter focused on exploring and explaining Web3 in Digestible ways to non-techies. Involves researching the smart contract docs and analyzing its data via Dune Analytics and Flipside Crypto. Subsacribe here at [Web3 Digestible](https://web3digestible.substack.com/).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with other data professionals on predictive modeling and natural language processing.
