Hi there 👋, my name is Adeoye Abolaji David (abd for short) and I am a chartered financial accountant that practiced as an auditor for over 5 years, till 2022. 

I decided to transition into the tech space though, into web2 and web3 data analytics. 
I am currently seeking open positions in a startup as a data or blockchain analyst. 

I could add value to any organization in various ways, inclusive of; 
* Financial analysis inclusive of building robust financial models. See some of [my projects here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gkt7Bm68O7Jy5mjga2H9FFFuvw_23RjD?usp=share_link).
* Data analysis using Excel & SQL complemented by delightful dashboards in Power BI & Tableau. See sample projects here.  
* Blockchain research and analysis via Dune Analytics e.g. [UNI Digestible](https://dune.com/abd010x/uni-digestible)
* Research on data & AI matters, inclusive of database design & development.
