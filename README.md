Hi there 👋, my name is Adeoye Abolaji David ([abd](https://linktr.ee/abd010x) for short) and I am a Chartered Accountant turned Data/Blockchain analyst. 

I enjoy learning and sharing on my data journey. Some projects are highlighted below;
* 👨🏾‍💻 Data Storytelling using SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. Hosted here.   
* 🌱 I’m building [Web3 Digestible](https://web3digestible.beehiiv.com/subscribe), a newsletter focused on exploring and breaking down Web3 in relatable, familiar ways to non-techies. Kindly subscribe. This is complemented by Blockchain storytelling found on [Dune](https://dune.com/abd010x)
* 💞️ I’m open to collaboration with other data professionals on predictive modeling (algo's), neural networks and natural language processing, as i am very curious on this lines of study.
